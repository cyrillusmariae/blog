This is my personal blog (or "online journal") to share my personal views and my daily life as a Traditionalist Roman Catholic Acolyte and Master of Ceremonies.

I write anything that I see and feel. Your comments or feedbacks are always welcome, if any, it should be directed to: chavezpoon@icloud.com.
