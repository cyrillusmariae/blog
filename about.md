## Who am I?

My name is Chavez Poon, I am a young Traditionalist Roman Catholic Acolyte and Master of Ceremonies in Hong Kong.

I'm an expert in Western Latin Rite Liturgies within the Roman Catholic Church, both Ordinary Form and Extraordinary Form of Roman Rite, and well as other kinds of Latin Rite Liturgies such as Ambrosian Rite, Lyonese Rite, Use of Sarum and Anglican Ordinariate Use.

For the past 10 years,  I have been served as an Acolyte and Master of Ceremonies for various communities and parishes. Currently, I regularly serves Holy Mass and other liturgies upon any invitations and appointments.

I also a member of the Confraternity of St. Peter. It is a society which gathers those who feel close to the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter and who wish to support its charism through prayers and sacrifices.

In my personal free time, I loves editing and publishing some various liturgical books such as Order of Holy Mass and other useful liturgical and prayer books into the internet, besides that, I loves playing music instruments such as drums and piano, I also obtained Grade 4 in Rock and Pop drums in the Trinity College London in January 2021.

I also loves collecting the vintage Roman Catholic vestments, old laptop computers and old operating systems.
