I had a discussion with my friends few months ago about how to evangilizing someone to let them know about the Catholic faith, many of them had their own ideas, but I want to share my idea which is a very good example about evangilizing people.

I remembered when I was in secondary school while I'm having my lunchbreak, I usually pray the rosary in the playground, then one day one of my classmate saw me praying the rosary, then he come over to me and asking what I'm doing, I told him that I'm praying the rosary, because my classmate is a non-Catholic, he was very interest about the rosary, so I briefly explained to him, after that, he decided to pray the rosary together with me then eventually, he was baptized as Catholic few years ago. Deo Gratias!

Jesus told us to spread the Gospel into the world, we should also know how to evangilize to the people, many people think they didn't know more about the Gospel, it dosen't matter, if you know how to pray, especially the rosary, try to pray either when you in the streets or inside the MTR.

Although some people might look at you what are you doing, but this ok, don't be afrard, just pray for the person who are curious about what are you doing.

Most of all, try your best to evangilize the whole nations through your daily actions!
